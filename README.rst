My Benchopt Benchmark
=====================
|Build Status| |Python 3.6+|

Benchopt is a package to simplify and make more transparent and
reproducible the comparisons of optimization algorithms.
This benchmark is dedicated to solver of **describe your problem**:


$$\\min_{\\beta} f(X, \\beta),$$

where $X$ is the matrix of data and $\\beta$ is the optimization variable.

Install
--------

This benchmark can be run using the following commands:

.. code-block::

   $ pip install -U benchopt
   $ git clone https://github.com/ambroiseodt/benchmark_ts_forecasting
   $ benchopt run benchmark_ts_forecasting

Apart from the problem, options can be passed to ``benchopt run``, to restrict the benchmarks to some solvers or datasets, e.g.:

.. code-block::

	$ benchopt run benchmark_ts_forecasting -s solver1 -d dataset2 --max-runs 10 --n-repetitions 10


Use ``benchopt run -h`` for more details about these options, or visit https://benchopt.github.io/api.html.
